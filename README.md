# get_ip_data
Integrates ipinfo.io's API to gather information about an IP address

Created this little program to get some more practice using APIs. ipinfo.io is a free API provider, all you need to do is get access to a token from them and insert it into the program, and it's all set. Input the IP address and it will return a list of strings identifying it.
